The AR Filters that you are gonna see in this repo are designed in Spark AR Studio by Facebook and with little bit of interaction tuning done using JavaScript.

## 1. Heart Description AR Experience
In this AR Experience you will be able to see a **Human Heart** with its parts labeled. You can also see the contraction and relaxation of Heart which is a Dynamic
Animation added using JavaScript. And if we want to know about a particular part in the heart we just need to tap on the particular name of the part for its 
Corresponding explanation to play. And lastly, we can tap on the heart to start and stop its rotation, we can also use 2 fingers to rotate it accordingly.

## 2. Plant Description AR Experience
In this AR Experience you will be able to see few types of **rare Plants**. In the middle you will notice a sphere which, when tapped starts the rotation of plants or stops the rotation. If we want to know about a specific plant from the shown plants, we just need to tap on that particular plant and the corresponding explanation plays in Background.

## 3. Mechanical Engine AR Experience
In this AR Experience you will be able to see few types of **Mechanical Engines**. On Right hand side you will see the numbering given to each engine and if we tap on a number that particular engines scales up and moves to the middle. So we can interact with the engine in 2 ways : By taping the engine which makes it rotate and by using the 2 fingers on screen we can have custom rotation.
